# Contributing

_This is a work in progress as the SIG is forming_

This process is currently being developed.
The resulting process will follow this general path, which is working currently:

1. __Giving feedback__ Feedback of any kind is always welcome.
Feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/operate-first/sre/issues/new) or send us a pull request (PR).
Details on how to make a PR is part of the [project-wide contribution docs](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/blob/master/contributing.md).
1. __Offering suggestions__ This SIG inherits the [contribution processes of the Operate First project](https://github.com/operate-first/apps/blob/master/contributing.md).
General project information is found on the [Getting Started](https://www.operate-first.cloud/getting-started) page.
1. __Focused contribution__ If you'd like to begin making specific or focused contributions, know more about what we do or find out about ways you can get involved, read about [becoming part of the Operate First community](https://www.operate-first.cloud/our-community).
You'll also want to familiarize yourself with the content and links in the [SIG-SRE README](https://www.operate-first.cloud/sre/README.html).

If you're submitting Markdown, please check for any linting problems.
The [vscode-markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) plugin can be used to do this in VSCode.
