## Current Architecture

* &lt;_If something is already solving the problem (even partially), here's where you mention it._>

## Proposed Architecture

* &lt;_Make it concise and simple; put diagrams; be concrete, avoid using vague generalizations._>

## Challenges

## Dependencies

* &lt;_Does this proposal depend on other things also being in place? List them._>

## Stakeholders
