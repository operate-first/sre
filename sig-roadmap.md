# SIG SRE roadmap

This is a roadmap for a site reliability engineering (SRE) community of practice.
It encompasses activities that include:
- Creating and sustaining discussions about areas of practice
- Initiating working groups (WGs) as a sign of forking a discussion into action oriented to creating one or more artifacts
- Artifact creation such as practice guides, tool sets, service catalogs, etc.

Discussions and decisions about this roadmap occur on the main group [sig-sre@operate-first.cloud](https://lists.operate-first.cloud/archives/list/sig-sre@operate-first.cloud/).
