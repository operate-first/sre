## Current Architecture

* &lt;_If something is already solving the problem (even partially), here's where you mention it._>


## Proposed Architecture

* &lt;_Make it concise and simple; put diagrams; be concrete, avoid using vague generalizations._>


## Challenges

## Dependencies

* &lt;_Does this proposal depend on other things also being in place? List them._>


## Stakeholders

* &lt;_Who needs to sign off on this proposal for it to be implementable?_>
